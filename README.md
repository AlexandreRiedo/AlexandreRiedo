I am a student at UNIGE's "Systèmes d'informations and sciences des services" Bachelor. Currently reading lots of fascinating books about flask, basic web front-end, and Java.

Here's the thing to note :I love jazz ! I'm currently learning jazz piano and jazz guitar at the "Conservatoire Populaire de Genève", and you'll often see me at Geneva's defacto jazz club/school called "AMR".
